## 💼 Experience
**Software Development Intern** — *Stopto-Optics* | Danyang, Zhengjiang, Jiangsu, China *(June 2025 – now)*  
[Company Home Page](http://www.stopto-optics.com/)  

- Made a device that can measure people’s eyes’ parameters from only one picture. All the calculations are done in a raspberry pi processor. By training a YOLOV11 object detection and segmentation model, the device can detect glasses and key points on people’s face. Use a Detph Camera(Orbbec 215) to get coordinates of keypoints in real-world to calculate the measruements such as pupil distance, pupil height, etc. 
- The YOLO model is trained using Ultralytics online, and export to onnxruntime format to accelerate running at raspberry pi.
